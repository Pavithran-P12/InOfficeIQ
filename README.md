# InOfficeIQ
InOfficeIQ is a smart and minimal tracker that helps hybrid employees calculate their required in-office days each month. By accounting for weekends, official holidays, and personal leaves, it ensures you meet your workplace's minimum in-office requirements (like 10 days/month) without the guesswork.
